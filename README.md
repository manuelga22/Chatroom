Type LOGOUT to leave the chatroom.

The program allows multiple clients to connect to a server and broadcast messages.
when you join the chat, every client is notified that you joined and when you leave 
the chat everyone is notified as well.

Run the Server.java file first and then open a terminal or command prompt and type nc -v 127.0.0.1 3050
to join the chat. As an alternative, just run the Client.java class multiple times.
